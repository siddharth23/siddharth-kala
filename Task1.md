## Risk Assessment

**Risks to Mitigate for This Application:**

- **Data Correctness Risk:** The correctness of data(expenses and income in different currencies), percentage calculation etc has to be correct
- Data Loss Risk: There is no login and purchase cannot be restored there is a risk of loosing data, or some settings can make loose the data.
- **Security Risk:** As authorization/authentication not there for some users it can be of greater concern
- The lack of intuitive designs can confuse users which can drop downloads
